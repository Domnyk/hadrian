# Hadrian

### Description
Hadrian is an application for renting sport objects (i.e swimming pools, football pitches) to groups of people. Application allows to rent an object and pay for it.

### Why 'Hadrian'?
Naming things is hard, espescially in programming. When I'am not sure how to name a project I look up some historic figure. This time it is a Roman emperor.
